# cltk

This is a Port of the [Ruby Language Toolkit](https://github.com/chriswailes/RLTK) to the [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) Programming Language. To See what works have a look at the specs or run them with:

```crystal
$ crystal spec
```

A WIP Example of a languagr designed with it can be found under '/kazoo'. The Code is very hacky at the moment and was translated merely by try and error with the testsuite (RED => GREEN but no Refactor atm.) Works with versio 0.14.2 of the crystal compiler. Only the AST Implementation is a complete rewrite.

## Usage

See the example Language under `/kazoo`
